		<p>Clint, </p>
		<br>
		<p> Thank you so much for all that you have done this semester. As a Programmer and Analysis student, I truly appreciate the lessons that you demonstrated to the class as well as the coding to perform the webpage application. It sure was a great pleasure to have me in your class this semester as I learned a lot in not only Java, but jsp pages controlled by Java. </p>
		<p> I now present to you my live site that I combined from all the assignments in this course and from the site that my WEBD 6201 professor suggested. Check it out below! <p>
		<p> As we come to a close this semester, I wish you all the best ahead. Be safe no matter where you are as we are still are fighting this virus. </p>
		<p> If I have you in the fall semester, I will see you then. </p>
		<p> Thank you and take care. </p>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p> Ethan </p>
